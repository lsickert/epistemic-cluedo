As described in the [Results](results.md), we found that the difference between second-order and first-order agents was not as big as we expected and that the second-order agents did not seem to have a huge competitive advantage over the first-order agents. This can be explained by the limitations we put on our implementation in the beginning, since a lot of the second-order epistemic logic for this game includes strategic lying, based on the knowledge of another players knowledge, which we excluded for this implementation, since it would require both a weight function of weighing the potential additional knowledge gain of including another unknown card in a suggestion against the diminished knowledge gain for other players by including an already known card or card in a players own hand. This could only for example be implemented by either calculating the knowledge gain of each player with each possible combination of known and unknown cards at each turn or by employing some form of heuristic to predict future suggestions based on the current suggestion. Both approaches are, however, computationally expensive to implement in combination with the rather ineffective way of storing the game knowledge in a logically sound Kripke model. It would be an interesting direction for future research to see if this could be achieved anyhow in a computationally effective way that does not limit the possibilities of playing the game too much.

In addition to the results from our our simulations, we also implemented several extensions and optimizations for the [mlsolver](https://github.com/erohkohl/mlsolver) package, which we plan to bring back into the original package, so that they can also be of use for other subsequent projects provided the package owner will accept our changes.
