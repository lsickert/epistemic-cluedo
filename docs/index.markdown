We modelled the game of Cluedo using epistemic logic with several different types of agents that have access to different levels of higher-order knowledge. We run several simulations to compare which advantage different deduction techniques available to these agents have on the outcome of the game and if a higher order of knowledge does indeed lead to an advantage in ultimately winning the game.
