Firstly we found that almost all games will end by a player making a suggestion that no other player has on their hand and therefore winning the game by default before a player was actually able to fully deduct the goal deck. While this usually does not happen as much with human players, it is a result of the technical limitations of our implementation, where players will only make an accusation when they have ruled out all but one possible card combination in the goal deck.
